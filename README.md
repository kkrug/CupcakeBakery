# Project Notes

Here is a version of a cupcake baking simulator. There is console output to describe each step that it is progressing through.

At the time of writing this, I am having some issues hosting on StackBlitz. It seems there are some bugs created with the latest Angular updates that have not been fixed on StackBlitz's end yet. I will update this if that changes or I find a workaround. This code should transpile and run locally.

Note that this only encompasses the baking of the cupcakes, and excludes the making of the frosting - making the frosting would require similar logic and concepts
already demonstrated.

Some interfaces were created an not used, such as a variety of cookware (pans, liners, etc.).

OverMixedBatterException is generated at random.

Other opportunities for expansion in this project would be additional oven capabilities, additional appliance capabilities,
making the frosting, and of course, an interactive front end.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
